Welcome to ActivityTracker

ActivityTracker is a web application for tracking time spent in all kinds of
activities. The goal of ActivityTracker is to allow teams and individuals to
log and report on how they are dividing their time across multiple and sometimes
competing tasks. When used as a diary of time spent, ActivityTracker can help
teams and individuals improve productivity and prioritize work.
